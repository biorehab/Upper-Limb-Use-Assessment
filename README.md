# Upper Limb Use Assessment

This is a repository of jupyter notebooks and python scripts used for analyzing upper limb use measures.

The code was developed for executing it in Google Colab. So, to test this code, you will need to download the repository, and upload it into your Google Drive. Once uploaded, you should be able to run the Python notebooks files using Google Colab. The data generated from the notebooks are saved on Google Drive.

There is a variable that needs to be modified in each notebook when you want to execute the code from your Google Drive. This is explained in the individual notebooks.

## Notebooks in the repository
There are two notebooks in this repositoy:


[**results.ipynb**](https://github.com/biorehab/upper-limb-use-assessment/blob/master/notebooks/results.ipynb)

Generates results from paper on upper limb use assessments.

[**generate_classifier_outputs.ipynb**](https://github.com/biorehab/upper-limb-use-assessment/blob/master/notebooks/generate_classifier_outputs.ipynb)

Generates and saves binary outputs using different upper limb use measures.
